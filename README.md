## My Professional Portfolio: the second phase

## My Journey and Development

Upgrading my first website to make it more functional and responsive. Using the knowledge I have gained from learing JavaScript, jQuery, and API. 



## Concept of the design and function

```
GIVEN I am new student to web development
WHEN a person access my profile
THEN they will come across some interesting facts about myself
WHEN they click on the nav bar
THEN it will take them  to certain sections of my website
WHEN they click on to my favorite places
THEN it will take them to sites with further information on my favorite places. 
WHEN they click submit after completing the form
THEN it will take them to the confirmation webpage
WHEN at the confirmation webpage, the person can click where indicated 
THEN they will return to the main page of my profile
```
